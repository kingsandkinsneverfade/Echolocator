# Project ECHOLOCATOR

**3D RF Imaging and Sonar-like System using WiFi and SDR**

---

## Overview

ECHOLOCATOR is a research project aimed at building a 3D scanning and imaging system using commodity WiFi hardware and Software Defined Radios (SDRs). By leveraging radio frequencies and signal processing techniques, the system performs real-time environment mapping similar to sonar but using RF signals.

This project integrates:

- WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) capture  
- SDR IQ sample collection  
- Advanced signal processing  
- Neural network modeling for environment reconstruction  
- Data fusion with global tracking systems  
- Secure communication and data handling
